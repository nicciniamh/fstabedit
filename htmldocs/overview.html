<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Linux/Unix Filesystem Table (/etc/fstab) is a file with deep roots in the UNIX legacy from a time when things needed to be terse so as not to consume space or memory, be fast to parse. Because of this, the format can seem a bit arcane. This leaves these entries prone to error. The use of this file and format dates back to at lease UNIX System V,  dating back to 1973!</p>
<p>The goal of this program is to simplify the editing of this file and to prevent errors from typing mistakes or specifying the wrong options for a filesystem. </p>
<p>For specifics on the format of /etc/fstab, please see the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/fstab.5.html">manual page</a> for it.</p>
<p>When the file is read and written all lines with comments are preserved and the data are written to the file in the line order in which they were read.  </p>
<p>This program can be run by a normal user, however, to save changes to /etc/fstab, the effective user id of the program must be the super user. This can be accomplished via sudo or gksudo. </p>
