Filesystem Table Editor
-----------------------
This program is very very alpha!!! 

BACK UP SYSTEM FILES FIRST! 


When /etc/fstab is saved it will be backed up to /etc/fstab~ 

Worst case recovery is you have a backup file is boot from a live cd and mount your root filesystem. Replace the broken /etc/fstab with your backup. 

Please see docs in doc/

Installer is a very basic, self-contained shell script installer.
